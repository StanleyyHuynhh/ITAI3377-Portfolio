IoT Sensors: Heart rate monitors, blood pressure devices, and oxygen saturation sensors attached to patients
Edge Devices: Local gateways that collect and transmit sensor data
Network Infrastructure: Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and cellular connections for data transmission
Backend Server: Flask-based API server that receives, processes, and stores patient data
AI Component: Threshold-based anomaly detection algorithm with potential for machine learning expansion
User Interface: Web dashboard for healthcare professionals to monitor patient status
2. Vulnerability Assessment
Device Vulnerabilities:
Sensor Tampering: Physical access to sensors could allow manipulation of readings
Data Spoofing: Simulated sensors susceptible to generating fraudulent vital sign data
Firmware Exploits: Outdated firmware on sensors or gateways may contain security flaws
Battery Depletion Attacks: Malicious actors could force devices to perform energy-intensive operations
Network Vulnerabilities:
Unencrypted Transmission: HTTP-based data transmission susceptible to interception
Man-in-the-Middle Attacks: Unsecured wireless connections vulnerable to eavesdropping
Denial of Service: System availability could be compromised by flooding the network
Unauthorized Access Points: Rogue access points could intercept legitimate traffic
Data Vulnerabilities:
Input Validation Gaps: Lack of robust validation could allow injection attacks
Insecure Storage: Patient data stored without encryption risks unauthorized access
Privacy Exposure: Health data represents sensitive personal information requiring special protection
Data Integrity Issues: Compromised data could lead to incorrect medical decisions
Application Vulnerabilities:
API Exploitation: Exposed endpoints without access controls susceptible to abuse
Authentication Weaknesses: Inadequate credential management for system access
Error Handling Leaks: Improper error responses might reveal system information
Dependency Vulnerabilities: Third-party libraries may contain security flaws
AI Model Vulnerabilities:
Threshold Manipulation: Current simple threshold model could be bypassed by carefully crafted inputs
Adversarial Attacks: Future ML models vulnerable to specially designed inputs that cause misclassifications
Model Poisoning: Training data manipulation could compromise detection capabilities
Explainability Gaps: "Black box" AI approaches may hinder security auditing
Human Factors:
Misconfiguration: Improper setup by technical staff could create security gaps
Social Engineering: Medical staff could be manipulated to reveal access credentials
Alert Fatigue: Excessive alerts may cause staff to ignore legitimate warnings
Insufficient Training: Lack of security awareness among users increases risk
