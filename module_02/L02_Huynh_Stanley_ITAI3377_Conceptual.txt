Step-by-Step Process for Model Deployment Using TensorFlow Lite
This section outlines each step in the process of building, training, converting, and running inference with a TensorFlow Lite model. For each step, there is a description of the key actions performed, followed by the areas of the code you should screenshot to capture each process.
Step 1: Installing Necessary Libraries
Before beginning the process, ensure that you have the necessary libraries installed. You can check the TensorFlow installation and install Jupyter Notebook (if not already done) by running the following commands:


Step 2: Loading and Preprocessing the MNIST Dataset
Load the MNIST dataset, preprocess it (normalize), and visualize some of the sample images. The following code loads the dataset and normalizes it:


Step 3: Defining and Training the Neural Network
In this step, you will define a simple feedforward neural network and train it using the MNIST dataset:


Step 4: Converting the Model to TensorFlow Lite Format
Next, you will convert the trained model into TensorFlow Lite format to make it more efficient for deployment on mobile or embedded devices:


Step 5: Loading and Running Inference with TensorFlow Lite
Now, load the TensorFlow Lite model and test it with a sample image from the MNIST dataset. The code for this step is as follows:


Step 6: Running Inference
Finally, run inference on a test image using the TensorFlow Lite interpreter:


By following these steps, you will have successfully built, trained, converted, and deployed a machine learning model using TensorFlow Lite. Each screenshot should correspond to the respective part of the code where you perform a key action.
